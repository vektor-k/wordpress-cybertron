    <h4> Buy MORE traffic at a CHEAPER price </h4>
    <span class="date">23/04/2010</span>
    <p>

We are happy to introduce the new option which would be useful for those of you 
who are looking to buy MORE traffic at a CHEAPER price and who does not mind 
receiving 1-day unique hits.<br><br>

As you know, Traffic Holder offers high quality 30-day unique traffic. 
<br><br>
We were receiving a lot of requests from our Buyers to implement an option for
traffic uniqueness control. From now you can place orders for 1-day unique
traffic at a 10% lower price. The discount price will be summarised with
the discount you already have with us, if you do. For instance, if you have
placed our button on your page and a 5% discount is already applied to your
orders, you get a 15% discount price for 1-day unique traffic.
<br><br>
You can test out the new option when placing your orders ("Uniques" field is
set to 30 days by default).
<br><br>
The new option does not affect the overall traffic uniqueness either quality.
As always you are welcome to purchase 30-day unique hits at a regular price.

    <h4>Daily Budget and Traffic Volume Limit Feature </h4>
    <span class="date">05/03/2010</span>
    <p>

Traffic Holder has implemented new options which will let you limit your daily 
budget and amount of traffic you receive per day. As many of you probably know,
the traffic volume we send may vary depending on many things (amount of traffic
we have available, your current bid, amount of active orders, etc.). If you're
not receiving enough traffic, you may try choosing other niches, countries or
websites to buy traffic from and place more orders. You can be sure you will not
run out of money.<br><br>

If you purchase traffic for feeding your sites - for example - you might want to 
limit the daily traffic volume you receive. If you convert traffic - on the other
hand - you probably want to adjust your daily budget. You're welcome to try these
two options available in the "My Campaigns" menu inside your account and start as
many campaigns as you like.<br><br>

Remember, you're also able to limit the amount of traffic by setting up "Max Hourly Forces"
(this option is available when you place an order or in the "Edit Order" menu)

Please make sure yourdomain.com is replaced with your domain name. You may put a link to this order form on your 
website or webmaster page. Sample is below:
<br><br>        
<a href="http://trafficholder.com/cgi-bin/traffic/manager/order2.cgi?public&order=yourdomain.com" target=_blank>

<b> PRIVATE SELLING OPTION</b>

Direct Order link to your Client and start selling traffic directly from your site to your own Direct Buyers. While 
setting up this feature you may want to HIDE your domains from being published in the "Available Traffic" list.
